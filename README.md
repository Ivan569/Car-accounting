#Introduction
This software development can be used in road transport companies for the purpose of controlling information about sold vehicles.
The goal is to create a database and a program that allows you to record information about cars sold.
#Tasks:
Define input and output data
Develop an optimal algorithm for solving the problem
Develop a program in the C programming language#
Implement a program (writing a program in Visual Studio 2019 C# for Windows)
Test the program and compile the programs.
Select data by a certain condition, output data
Overview of methods and tools for solving the problem
#Tools:
Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft. With Visual Studio, you can develop: Classic applications for a computer running the Windows operating system; Mobile applications (Windows, iOS, Android); Web applications; Cloud applications; Various extensions for Office, SharePoint, as well as creating your own extensions for Visual Studio; Games; SQL Server and SQL Azure databases. In Visual Studio, you can use the following technologies and programming languages: .NET, Node.js, C, C#, C++, Python, Visual Basic, F#, JavaScript.
Microsoft Office Access is a powerful editor that is a database management system based on a relational model. It should also be noted that it uses a dynamic exchange model between network resources and applications. At the same time, the editor uses advanced tools to process any type of information and present them in a clear, consistent structure.
#Methods:
1. Using the acquired knowledge in the process of solving practical problems or problems that require the integration of knowledge from different subject areas.
2. Development of cognitive skills, the ability to independently construct their knowledge, navigate the information space, the development of critical and creative thinking.
3. Correctly implement the task and follow the instructions.
4. Apply search, presentation, and other skills.
5. Reference to literary sources of information.
#Problem statement
1. Defining input and output data
2. Development of the algorithm, its representation in the form of a flowchart
3. Development of a program in the C programming language#
4. Implementation of the program 
5. Program testing and program compilation, data entry
6. Data selection by a certain condition, data output
Software implementation and testing
For each sale, the program records the following information::
• Car make (text)
• Color (select from the list)
• Year of manufacture (number)
• Date of sale (date)
• Amount (number)
The program implements two forms:
Main form - a form that contains a list of cars sold (brand + amount) (listbox). The main form contains the main menu (mainmenu), which consists of two sections:
Files - > Upload, Save
Edit -> Create, Edit, Delete.
A context menu with items (Create, edit, delete) is linked to the list. When you select the menu items "Create" and "Edit", a second form appears on the screen, in which information about the car is entered.
The auxiliary form contains the following elements:
• Car make (text)
• Color (select from the list)
• Year of manufacture (number)
• Date of sale (date)
• Amount (number)
As well as two buttons " OK " and "Cancel". When you click OK, all changes are displayed in the list. When you click the "Cancel" button, the changes are not included in the list.
Information about all listed vehicles can be saved in the Microsoft Office Access database.
You can also open a database (Microsoft Office Access) containing a list of cars.
